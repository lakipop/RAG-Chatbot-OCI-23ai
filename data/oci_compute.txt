OCI Compute provides flexible, secure, and high-performance virtual machines (VMs) and bare metal servers that enable customers to run their applications in the cloud. OCI offers a wide variety of compute shapes optimized for different workloads, from general-purpose applications to memory-intensive databases and GPU-accelerated machine learning tasks. Customers can choose from VM instances that share underlying hardware for cost efficiency, or bare metal instances that provide dedicated physical servers for maximum performance and isolation. This flexibility allows organizations to match their compute resources precisely to their application requirements.

One of the standout features of OCI Compute is its pricing model and performance characteristics. OCI offers bare metal instances at highly competitive prices, providing raw hardware performance without the overhead of virtualization. For customers who need the flexibility of VMs, OCI provides standard, dense I/O, and GPU-based shapes. The platform also offers burstable instances for workloads with variable CPU usage patterns, allowing customers to save costs on applications that don't require constant high CPU performance. OCI's live migration technology enables VM maintenance without downtime, ensuring business continuity even during infrastructure updates.

OCI Compute integrates seamlessly with other OCI services to provide a complete infrastructure solution. Instances can be connected to Block Volumes for persistent storage, File Storage for shared access, or Object Storage for massive-scale data repositories. Networking capabilities include Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs) with customizable subnets, security lists, and network security groups for fine-grained traffic control. For high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, OCI offers cluster networking with RDMA connectivity, enabling thousands of cores to work together with ultra-low latency. This makes OCI particularly suitable for scientific simulations, financial modeling, and large-scale data analytics.

Security and management features in OCI Compute ensure that workloads run safely and efficiently. All instances support full-disk encryption, and customers can use their own encryption keys through integration with OCI Vault. Instance metadata and cloud-init support enable automated configuration and deployment of applications. OCI provides detailed monitoring and logging through the Observability and Management Platform, giving operators full visibility into instance performance and health. Auto-scaling capabilities allow compute capacity to automatically adjust based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency. For disaster recovery and backup scenarios, customers can create custom images of their instances and replicate them across regions.
