Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a comprehensive, deep, and broad platform of public cloud services that enables customers to build and run a wide range of applications in a scalable, secure, high-performance environment. Unlike traditional cloud providers, OCI offers a unique combination of high-performance computing, storage, networking, and database services, all built with security and compliance as core design principles. OCI provides customers with better price-performance than other cloud providers, making it an attractive option for enterprises looking to optimize their cloud spending while maintaining top-tier performance.

One of the key advantages of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is its architecture. OCI is built with a distributed cloud model that allows organizations to run applications both in public cloud regions and in their own data centers through Oracle Cloud@Customer. This hybrid approach gives businesses the flexibility to meet data residency requirements, comply with regulatory mandates, and maintain low-latency access to critical applications. OCI's global network of regions ensures high availability and disaster recovery capabilities, with each region consisting of multiple availability domains for added resilience.

OCI offers a comprehensive suite of services including compute, storage, networking, databases, analytics, AI and machine learning, integration, security, and observability. The platform supports both modern cloud-native applications built with containers and microservices, as well as traditional enterprise workloads. Oracle's commitment to open standards and multi-cloud interoperability means customers can easily integrate OCI with their existing technology investments and avoid vendor lock-in.

Security is a fundamental pillar of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. OCI provides built-in security features such as encryption by default, isolated network virtualization, and dedicated security hardware. The platform is designed with a security-first approach, offering customers granular control over their resources through Identity and Access Management (IAM), security zones, and cloud guard. OCI has achieved numerous compliance certifications including FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOC, making it suitable for highly regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, and government.
